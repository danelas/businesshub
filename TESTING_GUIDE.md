# 🧪 Florida LLC Testing Guide

This guide shows you how to test the Florida LLC data pipeline and contact enrichment system **without needing API keys**.

## 🎯 What You Can Test

✅ **Florida LLC Data Ingestion** - Pull real data from Florida SFTP  
✅ **Contact Enrichment Pipeline** - Mock phone/email discovery  
✅ **Data Cross-Referencing** - See how leads get enriched  
✅ **Dashboard Visualization** - View all phone numbers and contacts  
✅ **Database Operations** - Full CRUD operations  

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Deploy to Render

```bash
# Push all changes to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Add Florida LLC testing system with dashboard"
git push origin main
```

Then deploy via Render dashboard (connects to your GitHub repo).

### 2. Set Up Database

Once deployed, run migrations:

```bash
# In Render shell or locally with production DATABASE_URL
npm run migrate
npm run setup-florida
```

### 3. Add Test Data

```bash
# Add sample Florida LLCs for testing
npm run add-test-data
```

## 📊 Test Dashboard

Visit your deployed app at:
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/test/dashboard
```

### Dashboard Features:

🏢 **LLC Statistics**
- Total Florida LLCs in database
- Count with phone numbers
- Count with email addresses  
- Overall contact discovery rate

📋 **Recent LLCs Table**
- Company names and registration dates
- Cities and addresses
- **Phone numbers** (highlighted in green)
- **Email addresses** (highlighted in blue)
- Enrichment status

🔄 **Interactive Controls**
- **Sync Florida Data** - Downloads real LLC data from Florida SFTP
- **Enrich Contacts** - Runs mock contact discovery (70% success rate)
- **Refresh Dashboard** - Updates all data in real-time

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Data Sync
1. Click **"Sync Florida Data"** 
2. Watch as real Florida LLC data gets downloaded
3. See new companies appear in the table
4. All will show "pending" enrichment status

### Scenario 2: Contact Enrichment
1. Click **"Enrich Contacts (Test Mode)"**
2. Mock enrichment finds phone/email for ~70% of leads
3. Table updates with green phone numbers and blue emails
4. Status changes to "completed" for enriched leads

### Scenario 3: View All Phone Numbers
- All discovered phone numbers appear in the **Phone** column
- Format: `+1305555XXXX` (realistic Florida area codes)
- Green highlighting makes them easy to spot
- Click refresh to see latest results

## 📱 Mock Contact Data

The test system generates realistic contact info:

**Phone Numbers:**
- Uses real Florida area codes (305, 407, 813, etc.)
- Format: `+1{area_code}{7_digits}`
- Example: `+13055551234`

**Email Addresses:**  
- Based on company name: `info@{company_name}.com`
- Example: `info@sunshinetechsolutions.com`

**Websites:**
- Clean company URLs: `https://www.{company_name}.com`
- Example: `https://www.floridadigitalmarketing.com`

✅ **Database Schema** - Proper storage and indexing  
✅ **Contact Enrichment** - Phone/email discovery logic  
✅ **Cross-Referencing** - Matching companies to contact info  
✅ **Scalability** - Handles batch processing  
✅ **UI/UX** - Clean dashboard for viewing results  

## 🔄 Real vs Mock Data

| Component | Test Mode | Production Mode |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **LLC Data** | ✅ Real Florida SFTP | ✅ Real Florida SFTP |
| **Phone Numbers** | 🧪 Mock (realistic) | 🌐 Google/Yelp/etc |
| **Email Addresses** | 🧪 Mock (realistic) | 🌐 Web scraping |
| **Websites** | 🧪 Mock (realistic) | 🌐 Search results |
| **Success Rate** | 🧪 70% (configurable) | 🌐 30-50% (real-world) |

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you see the test system working:

1. **Add Real API Keys** in Render dashboard:
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` for emails
   - `TEXTMAGIC_API_KEY` for SMS
   
2. **Enable Real Enrichment** by updating contact enrichment service

3. **Scale Up** by increasing daily limits and batch sizes

4. **Monitor Performance** using the built-in statistics

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**No Data Showing?**
- Run `npm run add-test-data` to add sample LLCs
- Check database connection in `/health` endpoint

**Sync Failing?**  
- Florida SFTP uses public credentials (no API key needed)
- Check network connectivity to `sftp.floridados.gov`

**Dashboard Not Loading?**
- Verify `/api/test/dashboard` endpoint is accessible
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## 📞 Where to See Phone Numbers

**Primary Location:** Test Dashboard Table
- URL: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/test/dashboard`
- Column: "Phone" (highlighted in green)
- Format: `+1305555XXXX`

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "leads": [
    {
      "company_name": "Sunshine Tech Solutions LLC",
      "phone": "+13055551234",
      "email": "info@sunshinetechsolutions.com",
      "city": "Miami"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Database Query:**
```sql
SELECT company_name, phone, email, city 
FROM leads 
WHERE state = 'FL' AND phone IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY registration_date DESC;
```

This testing system lets you see the **complete Florida LLC pipeline in action** - from data ingestion to contact discovery - all without needing external API keys! 🎉
